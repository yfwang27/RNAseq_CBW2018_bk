1.  Using the differentially expressed genes in KOa vs FFa (FDR 0.05 and and fold change ratio > 2) from the differentially expressed gene analysis, perform the Gene Ontology (for biological process and molecular function) and KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis.


2. Annotate the goseq results further by change the Kegg pathway id to name.
