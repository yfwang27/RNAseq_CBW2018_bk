Building on from last exercise, we will now use visualization tools to asess data quality.


1. Transform the count data using rlog and vst method.


2. a) Perform the Principal Component Analysis using rlog method and find out % significance values of first two principal components .


  b) Repeat the PCA, this time using VST method and compare the plots with the ones obtained using rlog method.
 
3. Perform clustering based on sample to sample distances and compare it with the clusters obtained using PCA.


4. Draw a heatmap of count matrix based on top 40 differentially expressed genes using rlog and vst data.
